This repository is meant to be a set of notes that can take someone from knowing nothing about what deep learning means to get to the point where you understand the underlying math behind deep learning. I am new to this field myself and take no responsibilty on the accuracy of the material written here.
This project is meant to be more of a meta exploration into how quickly someone with no knowledge of any field whatsoever, can jump into a buzzword and try to grasp its complexity and get something useful done with.
It is more of a mental dump of what I think deep learning is onto a piece of paper. As someone famously said, you do not understand something unless you can explain it to a child. I'd like to think of this project as my exploration on how I could explain everything I've learnt so far to someone with no relevant knowledge in the field.
Every once in a while, you could look at this table and test yourself on how much you have improved on your existing knowledge on how things work.

# TODO: add a table of contents section, add links ...
* Introduction - Shapes
1. The first and foremost thing to be done would be guage yourself on your knowledge of Mathematics.
2. Things could start off simple, with a question on what mathematics means to you?
3. The first topic that you'd test yourself on would be, do I know how areas work? Can I derive the areas of simple shapes and figures?
4. These shapes and figures would be just squares, rectangles and triangles.
5. I'd come up with explanations on how the formulas for their (shapes) areas work and how I can derive the areas of other shapes from them.
6. Triangulation and splitting of shapes into other small shapes would be the next topic.
7. A good resource for this would be the Khan academy videos.
8. Next, is to reason on the area of circle and why it's shape is the resulting of having a polygon with infinite sides.
9. The concept of infinities would be discussed here for the first time and its importance to the above problem too.
10. Once we get to some mathematical definition of the circle's area based on splitting it into triangles, we can start our journey onto limits

* Calculus
1. What is calculus? Start by learning what limits are.
2. Then we proceed towards, differentials, integrals and then finally onto partial derivatives.
3. This should equip us with the knowledge for starting to learn the actual math behind deep learning.

* Computers and what they can do for us
1.

* Deep Learning
1. What are neural networks. Side discussion -> How our brains work ...
2. A few more topics before we get to the current stage of research.

* Addendum
1. There should be a way of testing people on how much they know about field and then customizing / tailoring a path for them to learn to know more about the field.
2. One possible approache to this would be having a questionnaire asking them their knowledge on various things.
